So, there are two potatoes at their high school prom; we'll call them
Mr. and Mrs. Potatoe. They're not married, it's just for convenience.<br>
Anyways, so they're dancing, and Mrs. Potatoe says to Mr. Potatoe "Hey
honey, could you get me some chex-mix? I'm kind of hungry." So Mr.
Potatoe goes over to the snack table and comes back two seconds later
with the chex-mix. Mrs. Potatoe says "How did you get that so quickely?
There's a huge group of people around the snack table!" and Mr. Potatoe
says "Actually, there was no line for the chex-mix."<br>
So they dance for a little while longer, and Mrs. Potatoe starts

me some cheeseits?" So Mr. Potatoe goes over to the snack table and
