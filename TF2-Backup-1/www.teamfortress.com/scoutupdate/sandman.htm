					<div id="sandman_desc">You Scouts are gonna love this highly collectible bat that smacks baseballs at the other team, stunning the living crap outta anybody dumb, slow, drunk, mute or Australian enough to get in the way. The farther the ball flies before ricocheting offa some chucklehead's skull, the longer he's gonna be stunned. And guys who think they're tough because they're invulnerable? <i>It works on them too</i>. Now the bad news: You can't double jump when you're carrying this little beauty. On the other hand, double jumping never put anybody in a coma.</div>

					<div id="sandman_c"><strong>C.</strong> Get in there and take some cheap shots! You deserve it. So does he. Batter SWING!</div>
					<div id="sandman_b"><strong>B.</strong> Now laugh at the guy because he ain’t doin’ nothin for a while but gettin’ beat on.</div>
					<div id="sandman_a"><strong>A.</strong> Hit a guy with the ball to stun him. The farther the ball travels, the longer he’s gonna be out.</div>
